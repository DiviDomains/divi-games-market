# Season market · Divi Games

Join the live trading season, then buy and sell its DIVI for its GOLD on an order book against the house market maker and other players.

This is the game from [games.divi.domains/play/market](https://games.divi.domains/play/market/) as a folder
you can run on your own computer. It is only the page: the chain it plays on is the live Divi Games chain, so
you play against the same players, with the same testnet GOLD, as on the website.

## Run it

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or newer and Git. Nothing else gets installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DiviDomains/divi-games-market.git
cd divi-games-market
node serve.mjs
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 and play. Press **Ctrl-C** in the terminal to stop.

## How it works

The game is a web page and a few JavaScript modules, run by your browser. A browser page may only talk to the
address it came from, so `serve.mjs` does two jobs on that one address:

- it serves the files in this folder, and
- it passes every request for `/chain/…` (and the live block feed) on to `https://games.divi.domains/chain/`.

Every move you make is a transaction signed in your browser and sent to the live chain. The chain checks the
rules, so a changed page can only ever send moves the chain accepts.

## Your play key

The page makes a **testnet play key** the first time you open it and keeps it in your browser. Browsers keep it
per address, so the key at `127.0.0.1:8080` is a new one, not the one you use on games.divi.domains. To play
with the same GOLD in both places, open **Play key** on the page, press **Show WIF** on one, and paste it into
the import box on the other. Treat the WIF like a password: anyone who has it can spend that key's GOLD.

New keys start with no GOLD: press the **faucet** button for some.

## Change it

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `play/market/index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` | the game page |
| `play/brand.css` | the colours and fonts shared by every game |
| `sdk/divigames.js` | the client library: keys, signing, sending transactions, reading the chain |
| `vendor/` | the audited [@noble](https://paulmillr.com/noble/) cryptography libraries the SDK uses |
| `serve.mjs` | the small server above |

Edit a file and reload the page; there is no build step. The
[Build a game](https://games.divi.domains/learn/build-a-game) course explains the SDK and how a game talks to
the chain.

Links to the site's other pages (the leaderboard, your account, the other games) open on games.divi.domains.

## Options

```sh
PORT=9000 node serve.mjs         # another port
HOST=0.0.0.0 node serve.mjs      # let other computers on your home network open it
```

## When something goes wrong

- **"Port 8080 is in use"**: something else has that port. Pick another with `PORT=`.
- **"Could not reach https://games.divi.domains"**: your computer is offline, or the site is down.
- **No balance and the buttons fail**: open the address `serve.mjs` printed. Opening `index.html` as a file
  does not work, because the page needs `/chain` at its own address.
