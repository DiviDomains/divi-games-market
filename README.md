# Season market · Divi Games

Join the live trading season, then buy and sell its DIVI for its GOLD on an order book against the house market maker and other players.

This is the game from [games.divi.domains/play/market](https://games.divi.domains/play/market/) as a folder
you can run on your own computer. It is only the page: the chain it plays on is the live Divi Games chain, so
you play against the same players, with the same testnet GOLD, as on the website.

## Run it

Pick one. Each needs only what it names; nothing else gets installed.

**With Node.js** ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or newer, and Git):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DiviDomains/divi-games-market.git
cd divi-games-market
npm start
```

Your browser opens at http://127.0.0.1:8084/play/market/. Press **Ctrl-C** in the terminal to stop.
(`node serve.mjs` does the same without opening the browser. `npm install` is not needed: there are no
dependencies.)

**With Docker** ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Compose, and Git):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DiviDomains/divi-games-market.git
cd divi-games-market
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:8084/play/market/. Press **Ctrl-C** to stop, or run it in the background with
`docker compose up --build -d` and stop it with `docker compose down`.

**All four games at once**: each game has its own port (tic-tac-toe 8081, blackjack 8082, tower defense 8083,
season market 8084), so they run side by side. The
[Run a game at home](https://games.divi.domains/learn/build-a-game/06-run-it-at-home) lesson has one
`compose.yaml` that starts all four.

## How it works

The game is a web page and a few JavaScript modules, run by your browser. A browser page may only talk to the
address it came from, so `serve.mjs` does two jobs on that one address:

- it serves the files in this folder, and
- it passes every request for `/chain/…` (and the live block feed) on to `https://games.divi.domains/chain/`.

Every move you make is a transaction signed in your browser and sent to the live chain. The chain checks the
rules, so a changed page can only ever send moves the chain accepts.

## Put it on IPFS, or any plain file host

`npm run static` (or `node static.mjs`) writes `dist/`: the game alone, with nothing to run. Each page names the
chain it plays on in a meta tag and its links are relative, so any host that serves files can serve it, under any
path. To publish it on IPFS:

```sh
npm run static
ipfs add -r --cid-version 1 -Q dist      # prints the folder's CID
```

and open `/ipfs/<CID>/` on your IPFS node's own gateway, the `http://127.0.0.1:…` address that `ipfs daemon` (or
IPFS Desktop) prints as "Gateway server listening". The chain only answers
pages from games.divi.domains and from your own computer (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`), so a public gateway shows
the game but cannot play it. `--chain URL` points the copy at another chain, such as one you run yourself;
`--site URL` is where its links to the leaderboard and the other pages go. The
[Run every game four ways](https://games.divi.domains/learn/run-every-game) course covers IPFS and Tor step by
step.

## Your play key

The page makes a **testnet play key** the first time you open it and keeps it in your browser. Browsers keep it
**per address**, so `127.0.0.1:8084` gets a new key with no GOLD: not the one you use on
games.divi.domains, and not the one another game at home uses. Press **Get GOLD** for some, or keep one
identity everywhere in either of two ways:

- **Connect a wallet** (Browser Wallet, Web Wallet or Telegram) on each page: you play as your wallet's
  address wherever you open the game.
- **Import a key**: open **Play key** on the website, press **Show WIF**, and paste it into the import box on
  the page here. Treat the WIF like a password: anyone who has it can spend that key's GOLD.

`127.0.0.1` and `localhost` count as different addresses too, so stick to one.

## Change it

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `play/market/index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` | the game page |
| `play/brand.css` | the colours and fonts shared by every game |
| `sdk/divigames.js` | the client library: keys, signing, sending transactions, reading the chain |
| `vendor/` | the audited [@noble](https://paulmillr.com/noble/) cryptography libraries the SDK uses |
| `serve.mjs` | the small server above |
| `static.mjs` | makes the plain-file copy in `dist/` |
| `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml` | the Docker way to run it |

Edit a file and reload the page; there is no build step. (With Docker, run `docker compose up --build` again
after a change, since the image holds a copy of the folder.) The
[Build a game](https://games.divi.domains/learn/build-a-game) course explains the SDK and how a game talks to
the chain.

Links to the site's other pages (the leaderboard, your account, the other games) open on games.divi.domains.

## Options

```sh
PORT=9000 npm start              # another port
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start           # let other computers on your home network open it
```

With Docker, change the `ports:` line in `compose.yaml` instead: `"9000:8084"` for another port, or drop
the `127.0.0.1:` for your home network. Only let your home network in on a network you trust.

## When something goes wrong

- **"Port 8084 is in use"**: the game is already running in another terminal, or something else has the
  port. Stop the other one, or pick another port with `PORT=`.
- **`npm start` does not open a browser**: open the address it printed yourself.
- **"Could not reach https://games.divi.domains"**: your computer is offline, or the site is down.
- **No balance and the buttons fail**: open the address `serve.mjs` printed. Opening `index.html` as a file
  does not work, because the page needs `/chain` at its own address.
